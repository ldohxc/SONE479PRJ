<p> The workshop runs from 15th March 2015 to 19th March 2015 and will
take place at the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/bellairs/">Bellairs
Research Institute</a> in Barbados.  
</p>

<h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>The airport is on the south-east point of the island and Bellairs is
on the west side in the Parish of St. James (about a 40 minute taxi
drive).
<a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/Bellairs/15/images/bellairs.gif"> Here is a map of Barbados</a>. Tell the
taxi drivers to take you to <b>Bellairs Research Centre in
Holetown.</b>  Holetown is small and Bellairs is on the main (only)
street - it is just north of Folkstone Park.  The taxi ride should cost
about US $35.
</p>

<h2>Accommodations and Meals:</h2>
The cost of a room will depend on the room. The room allocations are made by the organizer, please do not contact the Bellairs staff to make room
bookings. Dinners will be served on site for US $25 per meal and breakfasts for US $7 per meal. 

<h2>Payment and Currency:</h2>
Payment at Bellairs can be made by credit card.
Throughout Barbados, US currency is freely accepted at 2 Barbadian
dollars per US dollar.  Other currencies (Pound sterling, Canadian dollars)
are not accepted; you will have to change them at banks or at the
airport. People had trouble using their bank cards from Europe, but
Canadian and US cards seem to work fine.  At the airport if you go around
to the departures side just after you arrive you will find cash machines
that will work. </p>

<h2>Internet:</h2>
There is wireless hookup for laptops
so you can bring your own laptop.  There is a small fee for using the
internet. 

<h2>Other things to know:</h2>
<p>Barbados is safe and one shouldn't worry about travelling
alone during the day. Good things to bring are suntan lotion or dark
skin, mosquito repellent, swimwear, papers/books/stationary and light
clothing (it will be warm).
