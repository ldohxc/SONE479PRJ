<p>Coalgebras have emerged as a unifying formalism for understanding a
variety of different types of dynamics.  From its inception it was
understood as giving a coherent theoretical framework to the theory of
transition systems and incorporating important concepts like bisimulation
and modal logics to characterize process equivalences.  These ideas were
applied successfully to a variety of different types of systems and most
recently to quantum systems.  At this workshop we hope to gather some of
the active participants in the theory of coalgebras and some of the active
researchers in quantum mechanics in order to discuss
recent developments and prospects. </p>

<br/><p> The workshop organizers are <a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash"> Prakash Panangaden</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~helle/">Helle Hvid Hansen.</a> Attendance is by
invitation only.
</p>

<p>The practice at these workshops has been to allow the speaker ample time
to get to technical details.  There should be lots of opportunities for
extensive discussions; we will not cram the schedule with lots of short
talks.  The talks are given on primitive chalkboards.  Please do not
prepare slides for a data projector or plastic transparencies.
There will be a parallel workshop on Infinite State Systems organized by
