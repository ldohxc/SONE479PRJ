More information   Engineering Development and Alumni Relations     Engineering Dean"s Report     McGill Alumni Online Community     McGill News Related Content Student Testimonials "My McGill education was filled with exceptional learning and unique opportunities to experiment and explore who I wanted to become. I worked on the McGill solar car, conducted research, and took advantage of the IYES program to do an 8-month telecome engineering internship in Paris. These experiences were all essential building blocks that led me to reach my first career goals: after McGill, I worked at McKinsey as a management concultant, then moved to Google's strategy unit and am now pursuing my MBA at Harvard Business School. I have lived in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and everywhere I go, I take with me the solid foundation and relationships built during my years at McGill."     Camille Tyan Graduated 2006, B.Eng. Electrical (Honours)         "I entered McGill's ECE program thinking that I would receive a sound and rigorous education to become a capable engineer, although in reality what I obtained from my four years there was much more than I would have ever imagined. I had professors passionate about their research, who excel and enjoy teaching, and genuinely care about their students in their mentoring role. Besides the technical foundations of engineering, I was trained to think critically and gained invaluable problem solving and quantitative analytical skills. After McGill, I pursued a Master's degree at Stanford University and then joined Deloitte Consulting LLP as a consultant for two years. Presently, I am a fourth year doctoral candidate at Harvard Business School studying the emergence and diffusion of scientific breakthroughs into technology commercialization. I have also completed all three levels of the Chartered Financial Analyst(r) curriculum."     Sen Chai BEng '05       "An Engineering degree doesn't limit you to a career as an Engineer, in fact it says to employers in all fields that you are smart, analytical, and able to deliver under pressure. After graduating from McGill, I landed an amazing leadership role at TELUS as a Business Analyst in Vancouver. This job combined technical skills with a business-focused management role. I am now completing a joint Law/MBA degree and have been offered jobs at top tier law firms, investment banks, and consulting firms in Toronto, all of whom were hugely impressed by my Engineering degree. My McGill education has proved incredibly valuable and versatile in opening doors for me...and now the sky's the limit!"   Peter Blanchard McGill BEng.

To create and maintain research activities which continue to be considered as world class when peer reviewed.   To provide an effective interface with industry both locally and around the world and to provide training and research that meets the needs of industry.   What is Computer Engineering?         It"s almost impossible to imagine our contemporary world without computer technology. Almost every facet of our society, whether in industry, health care, or domestic life, is dependent on computers in some form or another, and computer engineers make it all possible. They design and develop the hardware and software systems that have made computers so central to contemporary life. They research, design, develop, test, and oversee the installation of computer hardware and software and supervise its manufacture.   For more information on Computer Engineering please refer to:  What is Computer Engineering  [PDF]   What is Electrical Engineering?   Our society is powered by electricity and electrical engineering can be found at the core of the rapidly evolving high-tech industry. Electrical engineers design, build, test, and supervise the manufacturing and operation of a variety of electrical devices: from the power generation and distribution networks that power our homes and industries to the microchips that control our computers, video games and hospital equipment; from mobile phones to the internet and fibre optic and satellite communications; from robots in spacecraft to cars and industrial systems.   For more information on Electrical Engineering, please refer to:  What is Electrical Engineering  [PDF]   What is Software Engineering?   Software engineers design, develop and test complex software that applies computer technology to specific practical ends such as booking an airline ticket on-line, downloading e-mail or scanning items through a check-out line at the grocery store.They perform many of the same functions as general computer programmers, but software engineers apply the principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing, and evaluation of the software that enables computers to perform their many applications.

The award was presented at the plenary session of the IEEE International Solid-State Circuit Conference (ISSCC). The citation for the award is "In honor of an outstanding record of consistent leadership and initiative in organizing activities that have contributed to the growth and vitality of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society".   Prof. Vincent Hayward   Vincent Hayward named IEEE Fellow   Recognizing the achievements of its members is an important part of the mission of the IEEE. Each year, following a rigorous evaluation procedure, the IEEE Fellow Committee recommends a select group of recipients for one of the Institute"s most prestigious honors, elevation to IEEE Fellow.   Professor  Vincent Hayward  was awarded this honor, for his contributions to  "Robot Manipulator Programming and the Development of Haptics Interface Technology" .   Homecoming 2007   Joseph Mui; Photo- H. Mayer After the Dean"s breakfast at  Homecoming , Professor  Benoit Boulet  and Mr.  Joseph Mui  gave approximately 25 people a very interesting tour of the Trottier building and undergraduate lab facilities. Joe Mui, who has maintained many of the labs for nearly three decades can always be counted on to give visitors a very knowledgeable overview of the many changes in technology used in our labs. Benoit Boulet received many questions about curriculum, technology and our new facilities.   Professor Benoit Boulet talks to a group touring the Trottier building during Homecoming 2007;  Photo- H. Mayer Later the the group were taken on a walkabout through the engineering complex as many of the visitors had not been here for thirty or more years. They visited the new  Student Affairs  office and met  Nelly Vassileva  of the  Career Center , who answered many questions about Internship programs and other career planning topics.   Benoit Boulet appointed Director of CIM   Professor  Benoit Boulet  was recently appointed Director of the Centre for Intelligent Machines ( CIM ) for a three year term. Professor Boulet is an Associate Professor and the Associate Chair of Operations in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and is a registered professional engineer in the province of Quebec.   His research is concerned with finding practical solutions to automation and control problems in the areas of robust industrial process control, robust vehicle control, and manufacturing execution systems, and has earned him the distinguished title of  William Dawson Scholar , an internal McGill program which parallels the Canada Research Chairs program.   He has authored the textbook  "Fundamentals of Signals and Systems" , and is also the president of  Coronado Systems  , a consulting firm in control and automation.   Sam Musallam appointed Canada Research Chair   Professor  Sam Musallam  is one of 16 McGill researchers newly appointed Canada Research Chairs.  The Government of Canada created the Canada Research Chairs (CRC) Program in 2000 to establish 2,000 research professorships across the country by 2008, with the aim of making Canada one of the world's top five countries for research and development.   The  Neural Prosthetics Laboratory  explores the possible use of Brain-machine interfaces to assist paralyzed patients by allowing them to operate computers or robots with neural activity. The goal of this research is to study brain strategies for planning muscle movements, and to investigate the ways this strategy can be used to optimally drive external devices.   2007 Nanotech Ventures Award   Silk Displays Inc., a McGill spin-off with key technology based on the inventions of Professors  Ishiang Shih  of Electrical and Computer Engineering and  Mark Andrews  of the Department of Chemistry has won the Nanotech Ventures Award 2007.

Professor  Vincent Hayward  was awarded this honor, for his contributions to  "Robot Manipulator Programming and the Development of Haptics Interface Technology" .   Homecoming 2007   Joseph Mui; Photo- H. Mayer After the Dean"s breakfast at  Homecoming , Professor  Benoit Boulet  and Mr.  Joseph Mui  gave approximately 25 people a very interesting tour of the Trottier building and undergraduate lab facilities. Joe Mui, who has maintained many of the labs for nearly three decades can always be counted on to give visitors a very knowledgeable overview of the many changes in technology used in our labs. Benoit Boulet received many questions about curriculum, technology and our new facilities.   Professor Benoit Boulet talks to a group touring the Trottier building during Homecoming 2007;  Photo- H. Mayer Later the the group were taken on a walkabout through the engineering complex as many of the visitors had not been here for thirty or more years. They visited the new  Student Affairs  office and met  Nelly Vassileva  of the  Career Center , who answered many questions about Internship programs and other career planning topics.   Benoit Boulet appointed Director of CIM   Professor  Benoit Boulet  was recently appointed Director of the Centre for Intelligent Machines ( CIM ) for a three year term. Professor Boulet is an Associate Professor and the Associate Chair of Operations in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and is a registered professional engineer in the province of Quebec.   His research is concerned with finding practical solutions to automation and control problems in the areas of robust industrial process control, robust vehicle control, and manufacturing execution systems, and has earned him the distinguished title of  William Dawson Scholar , an internal McGill program which parallels the Canada Research Chairs program.   He has authored the textbook  "Fundamentals of Signals and Systems" , and is also the president of  Coronado Systems  , a consulting firm in control and automation.   Sam Musallam appointed Canada Research Chair   Professor  Sam Musallam  is one of 16 McGill researchers newly appointed Canada Research Chairs.

More information   Engineering Development and Alumni Relations     Engineering Dean"s Report     McGill Alumni Online Community     McGill News Related Content Student Testimonials "My McGill education was filled with exceptional learning and unique opportunities to experiment and explore who I wanted to become. I worked on the McGill solar car, conducted research, and took advantage of the IYES program to do an 8-month telecome engineering internship in Paris. These experiences were all essential building blocks that led me to reach my first career goals: after McGill, I worked at McKinsey as a management concultant, then moved to Google's strategy unit and am now pursuing my MBA at Harvard Business School. I have lived in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and everywhere I go, I take with me the solid foundation and relationships built during my years at McGill."     Camille Tyan Graduated 2006, B.Eng. Electrical (Honours)         "I entered McGill's ECE program thinking that I would receive a sound and rigorous education to become a capable engineer, although in reality what I obtained from my four years there was much more than I would have ever imagined. I had professors passionate about their research, who excel and enjoy teaching, and genuinely care about their students in their mentoring role. Besides the technical foundations of engineering, I was trained to think critically and gained invaluable problem solving and quantitative analytical skills. After McGill, I pursued a Master's degree at Stanford University and then joined Deloitte Consulting LLP as a consultant for two years. Presently, I am a fourth year doctoral candidate at Harvard Business School studying the emergence and diffusion of scientific breakthroughs into technology commercialization. I have also completed all three levels of the Chartered Financial Analyst(r) curriculum."     Sen Chai BEng '05       "An Engineering degree doesn't limit you to a career as an Engineer, in fact it says to employers in all fields that you are smart, analytical, and able to deliver under pressure. After graduating from McGill, I landed an amazing leadership role at TELUS as a Business Analyst in Vancouver. This job combined technical skills with a business-focused management role. I am now completing a joint Law/MBA degree and have been offered jobs at top tier law firms, investment banks, and consulting firms in Toronto, all of whom were hugely impressed by my Engineering degree. My McGill education has proved incredibly valuable and versatile in opening doors for me...and now the sky's the limit!"   Peter Blanchard McGill BEng.

In this thesis, control schemes for active and reactive power flows at the wind generator bus of connection as well as planning decisions that can be made by the distribution networks operators are proposed to alleviate the voltage fluctuations impact of the intermittent resource of electric power. More specifically, the following is proposed: a modification to conventional reactive power control schemes in order to treat voltage flicker independent of the steady-state voltage level and allow for flicker mitigation under injection of reactive power at the wind generators side; the use of a short-term energy storage system at the wind generators bus of connection, the sizing of the energy storage system is based on both the wind speed and the wind turbulence intensity at the installation site, the control and management of the storage system are tailored to the frequency band of voltage flicker; and finally, network-based planning solutions that modify the connection point characteristics and increase its flicker suppression capacity. All proposed solutions are studied from the flicker impact perspective and conclusions are drawn for their effectiveness in light of the given connection point characteristics and size of installed wind power. Sample results for all proposed schemes are reproduced on a distribution-network model in a real-time simulation platform for verification purposes.

In that particular area, his work was focused on providing wind power integration planning and control solutions to meet utilities grid connection requirements and satisfy IEC power quality standards. Given that his work on WGs was in the context of distributed generation, he developed broad familiarity with medium voltage equipment, conductors and the general operational concepts of distribution networks and discrepancies between renewable energy integration at the distribution and transmission levels. For his PhD, he worked under the supervision of Prof. Geza Joos at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McGill University.

Additionally, the low-power and low-supply voltage requirements of such systems are critical and are increasingly stringent. This thesis explores new techniques for the design of low-power low-voltage ADCs for high-resolution biomedical signal acquisition in portable devices. Subthreshold circuit design techniques, and in particular log-domain circuit techniques in Delta-sigma modulators, are utilized to realize these design objectives. Specifically, this work investigates the following: Multibit Log-Domain Delta-Sigma Modulators: Previously reported log-domain Delta-Sigma modulators were limited to 1-bit quantization and hence could not benefit from the advantages associated with multibit quantization. This thesis explores the challenges of multibit quantization and digital-to-analog conversion in the log-domain, and presents a novel multibit log-domain Delta-Sigma modulator, practical for CMOS implementation. It demonstrates the equivalence of the designed system to classical, internally-linear modulators. Furthermore, SIMULINK models are proposed, and the effects of various circuit non-idealities on the performance of the proposed multibit log-domain Delta-Sigma modulator architecture are investigated. Low-Distortion Low-Noise Loop-Filter Circuit Implementation: The realization of log-domain Delta-Sigma modulators targeting high-resolution applications necessitates a minimization of distortion and noise in the log-domain loop-filter. In this work, low-distortion log-domain circuit blocks are presented. Furthermore, the design trends of log-domain circuits are investigated and a novel noise-optimization method is proposed to meet the targeted high-resolution performance while maintaining low-power operation. The necessity of the low-distortion log-domain circuits and the design tradeoffs are validated through circuit-level simulations. Additionally, a low-noise current output DAC is proposed for the log-domain Delta-Sigma modulator. A class AB multibit log-domain Delta-Sigma modulator prototype was designed and fabricated in 0.13 mm CMOS technology. In simulation, the proposed modulator achieves 10.47-bit signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) over a 10 kHz bandwidth with a 0.84 Vpp differential signal input, while operating from a 0.8 V supply and consuming a total power of 46.7 mW. Results of the fabricated prototype to date indicate validate the operation of various circuits within the modulator, and demonstrate the criticalness of differential matching in Class AB log-domain Delta-Sigma modulators.

More information   Engineering Development and Alumni Relations     Engineering Dean"s Report     McGill Alumni Online Community     McGill News Related Content Student Testimonials "My McGill education was filled with exceptional learning and unique opportunities to experiment and explore who I wanted to become. I worked on the McGill solar car, conducted research, and took advantage of the IYES program to do an 8-month telecome engineering internship in Paris. These experiences were all essential building blocks that led me to reach my first career goals: after McGill, I worked at McKinsey as a management concultant, then moved to Google's strategy unit and am now pursuing my MBA at Harvard Business School. I have lived in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and everywhere I go, I take with me the solid foundation and relationships built during my years at McGill."     Camille Tyan Graduated 2006, B.Eng. Electrical (Honours)         "I entered McGill's ECE program thinking that I would receive a sound and rigorous education to become a capable engineer, although in reality what I obtained from my four years there was much more than I would have ever imagined. I had professors passionate about their research, who excel and enjoy teaching, and genuinely care about their students in their mentoring role. Besides the technical foundations of engineering, I was trained to think critically and gained invaluable problem solving and quantitative analytical skills. After McGill, I pursued a Master's degree at Stanford University and then joined Deloitte Consulting LLP as a consultant for two years. Presently, I am a fourth year doctoral candidate at Harvard Business School studying the emergence and diffusion of scientific breakthroughs into technology commercialization. I have also completed all three levels of the Chartered Financial Analyst(r) curriculum."     Sen Chai BEng '05       "An Engineering degree doesn't limit you to a career as an Engineer, in fact it says to employers in all fields that you are smart, analytical, and able to deliver under pressure. After graduating from McGill, I landed an amazing leadership role at TELUS as a Business Analyst in Vancouver. This job combined technical skills with a business-focused management role. I am now completing a joint Law/MBA degree and have been offered jobs at top tier law firms, investment banks, and consulting firms in Toronto, all of whom were hugely impressed by my Engineering degree. My McGill education has proved incredibly valuable and versatile in opening doors for me...and now the sky's the limit!"   Peter Blanchard McGill BEng.
